    <p> Hello, I'm Joann a first-year student taking BS Information Technology. I'm eager to learn and grow in this field. In my free time, I usually hang out with my friends and spend time with my family. I love investing my time with the people I value and loved the most. My ultimate aim is to achieve financial stability so that I can have a secure future and meet my financial obligations with ease. and btw I'm a huge fan of "LANY" and I love all of there songs.
