				<h2> About: </h2>
				<p> "Titanic (1997)" Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film written, directed, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Set against the historical backdrop of the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic, the film blends fiction with historical events, centering around a passionate love story between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), an aristocratic young woman, who are on board the ill-fated ship. </p>
				
				<p> The film's narrative alternates between the present day, where an elderly Rose (played by Gloria Stuart) recounts her experience aboard the ship to a group of treasure hunters searching for a valuable necklace, and flashbacks to the events of the 1912 voyage. As Jack and Rose fall in love, the tragedy of the Titanic unfolds, with the ship sinking after striking the iceberg, leading to a fight for survival amid the chaos. </p>
				
				<p> Titanic is known for its stunning visuals, its depiction of the disaster, and its exploration of themes like love, class disparity, fate, and sacrifice. It became one of the highest-grossing films of all time and won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film's iconic theme song, "My Heart Will Go On," performed by Celine Dion, also became a massive hit.</p>
